# rpi-data-api
A RESTful API for storing sensor data like temperature/humidity/co2, measured from a Raspberry Pi. 

Trying out Uncle Bob's ["Screaming Architecture"](https://youtu.be/2dKZ-dWaCiU?t=1403) and dipping my toes into test driven development.

Built with Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, MongoDB(Mongoose).
